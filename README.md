This project analyzes the World Happiness Report dataset, which provides insights into the state of global happiness. The dataset consists of happiness scores and rankings for 153 countries, along with factors that contribute to the overall happiness score. These factors include GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom to make life choices, generosity, corruption perception, and residual error.

The dataset is sourced from the Gallup World Survey, where respondents rate their life satisfaction on a scale known as the Cantril Ladder. The scores are based on representative samples from 2013 to 2016 and employ Gallup weights for accurate estimates.

This project aims to explore the relationships between happiness and various factors, shedding light on how economic, social, and individual aspects impact happiness levels across countries. It can be used for further analysis and research in fields such as economics, psychology, public policy, and more.

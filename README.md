This project analyzes the World Happiness Report dataset, which provides insights into the state of global happiness. The dataset consists of happiness scores and rankings for 153 countries, along with factors that contribute to the overall happiness score. These factors include GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom to make life choices, generosity, corruption perception, and residual error.

The dataset is sourced from the Gallup World Survey, where respondents rate their life satisfaction on a scale known as the Cantril Ladder. The scores are based on representative samples from 2013 to 2016 and employ Gallup weights for accurate estimates.

This project aims to explore the relationships between happiness and various factors, shedding light on how economic, social, and individual aspects impact happiness levels across countries. It can be used for further analysis and research in fields such as economics, psychology, public policy, and more.

 Running the Code with Dependencies
---
To run the code and ensure that all required dependencies are installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone <repository-url>
     ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```shell
   cd <project-directory>
     ```
3. Create a virtual environment (recommended) to isolate the project dependencies:
   ```shell
   python -m venv env
     ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
- For Windows
   ```shell
   .\env\Scripts\activate
     ```
- For macOS and Linux:
   ```shell
   source env/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the dependencies from the requirements.txt file:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
6. Once the dependencies are installed, start Jupyter Notebook and excute a notebook
